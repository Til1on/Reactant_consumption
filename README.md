# Reactant_consumption
Scripts to calculate consumption rates for reactants and return data insights

This repo will be populated with different scripts to calculate consumption rate / depletion rate for various reactants (materials).

Main goal of such scripts is:
* Exclude manual labor to calculate different rates and graphs of consumption / depletion
* Provide data in the form of excel files (spreadsheets) to be digested by BI tools
* Draw insights from the results of calculation to provide to the stakeholders


Stages of development:
1. Write an executable script to digest excel-files as input and provide excel-file as output.
2. Add data checks to input files.
3. Add data insights from output file, such as: dates of deficit, dates to start new contracting.
4. Add data visualizations.
